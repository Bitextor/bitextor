 * Static class which contains all the methods related with the heurisitcs used by the applicaiton to

 * -Edit distance between web page fingerprints (strings composed by XHTML tags and lengths of text bloks).
 * -File sizes comparison (in bytes).
 * -Plane text length (in characters).
 * -Differences in the URL of the files.

	 * This method applies the Levheinstein's edit distance algorithm on a pair of web file fingerprints. These
	 * fingerprints are strings of integers which represents the content of a file. The negative integers respresents
	 * the XHTML tags. In the class GlobalParams there is a HashMap with the correspondence between XHTML tag names and
	 * their integer code. The positive numbers represents text bloks (concretly, the positive numbers - included the 0 -
	 * reperesnts the length of these text bloks in characters). The edit distance algorithm applied assigns 1 as the
	 * cost of insertion, deletion and substitution for XHTML tags. For text bloks, the cost of insertion and deletion
	 * is 1 and the cost of substitution is MIN(LENGTH(text_blok1), LENGTH(text_blok2))/MAX(LENGTH(text_blok1), LENGTH(text_blok2)).
	 * This value of edit distance is returned to use it as a comparison value, but for the comparison of files in the
	 * method, another method is calculated. The user can define a maximum permited difference of text-bloks differnece
	 * of length. This parameter is defined in the configuration file and is used to determine if a pair of text bloks
	 * can be parallel (a tranlation) or not. So, the value used for comparsion between fingerprint is this. In this way,
	 * if the substitution cost between text bloks is higher than this threshold, the assigned cost is 1 and, if it is
	 * lower, the cost is 0. The resultaign value of this process is compared with the maximum edit-distance value set
	 * by the user in the configuration file. If the result is lower or equal than this value, the method returns true
	 * and, if it is not, the method returns false.
	 * @param wf1 First web file to compare.
	 * @param wf2 Second web files to compare.
	 * @param pathdistance This is an output parameter which returns the optimal path in the edit-distance algorithm
	 * grid.
	 * @param result Value of edit-distance using the difference proportion in text-bloks substitution operation.
	 * @return Returns <code>true</code> if the edit distance is lower than the threshold defined in the configuration
	 * file and <code>false</code> in other case. If there is no threshold defined in the configuration file, the method
