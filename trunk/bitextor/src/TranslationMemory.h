 * 
 * This class contains the necessary elements to generaty translation memories (TM) from the foud bitexts in a  website.
 * It manages the TMXs files which contains the TMs. This class can work in two ways: writting each TM in a different file
 * or writting all the translation unit (TU) in an only file for a given language pair. To work in the second way, this
 * class needs to manage as many files as language pairs exist in the website and it will only close these files when the
 * application has finished the complete process.
