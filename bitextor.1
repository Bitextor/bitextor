.SH DESCRIPTION
.PD 0
.B bitextor
is an automatic bitext detector which produces, from a multilingual crawled website,
a list of aligned documents. The user must provide a
.IR URL ,
a list of URLs in a
.I FILE
(one per line), the path to a
.I DIRECTORY
containing a crawled website, or the path to a
.I FILE
containing a list of previously downloaded websites.
It is also necessary to specify the two languages on which
the user is interested by setting the language IDs following the ISO 639-1. The tool
works following a sequence of steps.
.SS STEPS
.P
.B 1-
Downloads a website by using the tool httrack: see bitextor-downloadweb(1) (optional step);
.P
.B 2-
The files in the website are analysed, cleaned and standardised (XHTML): see bitextor-webdir2ett(1);
.P
.B 3-
The language of every webpage is detected: see bitextor-ett2lett(1);
.P
.B 4-
The HTML structure is analysed to create a representation which is used to compare the different webpages: see bitextor-lett2lettr(1);
.P
.B 5-
The a preliminary list of aligned-document candidates is obtained by computing overlapping metrics on bags-of-words: see bitextor-idx2ridx(1);
.P
.B 6-
The candidates are checked by using the XHTML structure computed in : see bitextor-distancefilter(1);
.P
.B 7-
The documents are aligned: see bitextor-align-documents(1);
.P
.B 8-
The aligned documents are segmented and aligned: see bitextor-align-segments(1) and bitextor-cleantextalign(1);
.P
.B 9-
The aligned segments are formatted into TMX standard format: see bitextor-buildTMX(1) (optional step).

.SH OPTIONS
.PD 1
.SS "Website sources"

.TP
.BI \-u " URL"
URL of a website to be crawled and processed.
.TP
.BI \-U " FILE"
Path to a
.I FILE
containing a list of URLs to be crawled and processed (one per line)
and the path to their corresponding target directory (where each of
them will be stored) separated by a tab.
.TP
.BI \-d " DIRECTORY"
Path to a
.I DIRECTORY
containing a crawled website. If option
.B \-u
is also enabled, then the
.I DIRECTORY
is used to store the website crawled.
.TP
.BI \-D " FILE"
Path to a
.I FILE
containing a list of directories to be processed (one per line).
.SS "Other options"
.TP
.BI \-I " DIRECTORY"
Target path where the intermediate files of each module will be stored (by default, they are stored
in a temporal directory which is removed at the end of the run)
.TP
.BI \-L " DIRECTORY"
Target path where the log files of each module will be stored (by default, they are stored in a
temporal directory which is removed at the end of the run)
.TP
.BI \-b " NUM"
When this option is enabled, only the first
.I NUM
candidates from the
.I RINDEX
candidate list are taken into account when
computing the bidirectional document alignment (see bitextor-distancefilter(1))
.TP
.BI \-v " FILE"
Option defining the dictionary
.I FILE
which relates words in two or more languages
to be processed in the website.
.TP
.BI \-m " NUM"
if the number of wrong alignments in a pair of documents processed by
bitextor-align-segments(1) is higher than
.IR NUM ,
the pair of documents is discarded (5 by default)
.TP
.BI \-q " NUM"
if the confidence score for a pair of segments aligned by bitextor-align-segments(1)
is lower than
.IR NUM ,
it is discarded (0 by default)
.TP
.B \-x
if this option is enabled, the output of bitextor
will be formatted as a standard TMX translation memory
.TP
.BI \-t " TMP_IR"
Alternative tmp directory (/tmp by default)
.TP
.BI \-O " OUTPUT_FILE"
Path to the
.I OUTPUT_FILE
where the output of bitextor will be saved (/dev/stdout by default)

.SH DEPENDENCES
.B bitextor
depends on the following external tools and libraries
which must be installed in advance:
.TP
.B langid
Python library that detects the language of a text file
.TP
.B python-Levenshtein
Python library that implements the Levenshtein edit distance between two strings
.TP
.B boilerpipe
Python library providing a Python interface to use the Java package
boilerpipe for cleaning those parts of an HTML file that contain useless
information, such as menus, adds, etc.
.TP
.B httrack
External tool used for crawling a website (this tool is not necessary to install Bitextor)
