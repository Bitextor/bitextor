README FILE OF BITEXTOR

1. Programs

	Bitextor -> This application downloads entire web sites and inspects
		    his pages to detect which of them has the same content
		    written in different languages. Before this, it generates
		    a TMX file for every bitext detected.

2. Dependences
	This application depends on the following tools/libraries:
		- LibTidy (packages 'libtidy-0.99-0' and 'libtidy-dev').
		- LibTextCat (packages 'libtextcat0', 'libtextcat-data' and 'libtextcat-dev').
		- LibXML++ (packages 'libxml++2.6c2a' and 'libxml++2.6-dev').
		- LibEnca (packages 'libenca0' and 'libenca-dev').
		- Flex (package 'flex')
		- Wget (package 'wget')

3. To run Bitextor
	Firstly, you have to set the parameters in config.xml, placed in bitextor-2.0.0/src/config.xml. You will have to change
	the parametters in the file conf.txt (the configuration file for LibTextCat) to introduce the correct path of the trigram
	files listed in the file. It's possible	that you want to change the parametters in config.xml in bitextor-2.0.0/ (the
	configuration file for LibTagaligner). Once you have set the configuration parametters, you can run Bitextor. To run Bitextor,
	you have two possibilities:
		- To download the files from a URL and compare them, you have to call Bitextor in this way:
			bitextor config_file_path -w url
		- If you have the files downloaded and you want to compare them, you can call Bitextor:
			bitextor config_file_path -d local_directory_with_html_files
