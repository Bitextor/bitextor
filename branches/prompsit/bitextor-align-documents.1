.SH NAME
bitextor-align-documents \- This application is part of
.B bitextor
( the automatic bitext generator )

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bitextor-align-documents
-l lettr_file [-n number_of_accepted_candidates] [rindex1] [rindex2]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bitextor-align-documents
is a shell program that produces the list of aligned documents from
the list of candidate alignments in the rindex files. It is possible
to provide one rindex file as the last argument or through the standard
input. It is also possible to provide two rindex files, one obtained when
looking for candidates from l1 to l2, and one from l2 to l1. Then, candidates
tables are crossed and candidates are re-ranked. If option -n is used, it is
possible to define the number of candidates to be taken into account. It is
worth noting that the maximum number of candidates used in any rindx file
is 10. The output of the script is a tab-sepparated list of aligned documents
with the name of the files in the first two columns and the content of both
files encoded in base64 in the two final fields of each line.
.PP
Receives files with formats .lett (or .lettr) and .ridx.
