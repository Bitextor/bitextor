.SH NAME
bitextor-idx2ridx \- This application is part of
.B bitextor
( the automatic bitext generator )

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bitextor-idx2ridx
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.BI \-\-lang1 " LANG1"
.BI \-\-lang2 " LANG2"
.RI [ FILE ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bitextor-idx2ridx
is a Python script reads the output of bitextor-lettr2idx(1),
either from the standard input or from a 
.IR FILE ,
and produces a list with the 10 most promising documents in
.I LANG2
to be parallel to each document in
.IR LANG1 .
The method uses the bag of words contained in every document and a dictionary
relating words in 
.I LANG1
and
.I LANG2
to compute an overlapping score between the documents in both languages.
The output format is a tab-sepparated file; for each line in this file,
the first field corresponds to the ID of a document in
.IR LANG1 ;
the following 10 fields are a list of tuples separated by a colon, in which
the left field is the ID of a candidate document in
.IR LANG2 ,
and the right field is the score assigned to the candidate.
.br
A default dictionary is distributed with
.B bitextor
for English, Spanish, Catalan, Croatian, and Basque, for computing the overlapping
scores. However, it is possible to provide a custom dictionary by using the option
.BI -d " FILE"
to determine the path to a dictionary. A dictionary must follow the following format:
.br
.P
- it must be a tab-sepparated file;
.br
- the first line must contain the language code for the words in every language included in the dictionary;
.br
- the rest of the lines must contain translations of a word into each of the languages specified in the first line.

.SH OPTIONS
